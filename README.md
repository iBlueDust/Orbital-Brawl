# Orbital Brawl
Submitted for [*GMTK Game Jam 2020*](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020)

## What is the GMTK Game Jam?
A game jam is a time-limited theme-based game-making competition.

This game jam's theme was **"Out of Control"**. The jam lasted 48 hours wherein all code, art, music, and assets for any games submitted must be originally produced. I developed this game in that manner. RIP sleep. Anyhow, hope you enjoy what I jerry-rigged together in my first game jam!

## Play
See the [Itch.io page](https://ibluedust.itch.io/orbital-brawl)

## Inspiration
Orbital Brawl is inspired by *Spacewar!*, one of the first computer games, developed in 1962 for the PDP-1, a massive computer that basically only universities and large companies then had. In that game, two spaceships shoot bullets to eliminate each other. The catch: the spaceships have almost-zero control over their movement as they are almost completely influenced by the gravity of a star in the center of the playfield.
